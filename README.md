A web application allow people to learn computer hardwares and systems' related knowledge and experiments. Future technical discussions and blogs on variety of system related algorithms in parallel programming, Machine Learning and System Design will also be posted.
The purpose of this project is to promote general understanding of computer hardware that we can buy and algorithms that we can implement to utilizes them.

Our interests span OverClocking and Performance in benchmark, parallel programming and system analysis, advance algorithms for systems , wireless networking, and network security. Our mission is to explore the unknown interactions among different components of hardware and investigate high-impact research avenues and translate them in an understandable way for everyone.
